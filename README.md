## Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

This is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning project to predict **sales amount** based on features like product category, quantity sold, discount, and more. The project was built using **Google Colab**, **Python**, and the **Linear Regression model**, showing how a Data Analyst can upgrade their skills with ML.

## Project Objective

The main goal is to predict the `Sales_Amount` for future transactions using historical sales data. This helps businesses make informed decisions about pricing, stock, and sales strategies.

---

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used contains features like:

- `Product_ID`
- `Sale_Date`
- `Sales_Rep`
- `Region`
- `Sales_Amount` (Target Variable)
- `Quantity_Sold`
- `Product_Category`
- `Unit_Cost`
- `Unit_Price`
- `Discount`
- `Customer_Type`
- `Sales_Channel`
- `Payment_Method`

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Google Colab**
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data handling
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** – visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – ML modeling
- **Joblib** – model saving

---

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading** – Load and preview the dataset
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle nulls, formats, and data types
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand data relationships visually
4. **Feature Engineering** – Convert categorical data and scale numeric data
5. **Model Building** – Train a Linear Regression model
6. **Model Evaluation** – Use R² Score and MAE for accuracy checks
7. **Model Saving** – Export the trained model using `joblib`
8. **Deployment Ready** – The model can be used in applications or dashboards

## 📌 How to Run This Project

1. Clone or fork this repository
2. Open the `Sales_Prediction_Model.ipynb` file in Google Colab
3. Run each cell from top to bottom
4. Test the prediction logic using sample input

---

## 📈 Output

The model is capable of accurately predicting `Sales_Amount` based on historical sales patterns with a good R² score. This shows how a Data Analyst can contribute to data-driven sales forecasting using Machine Learning.
